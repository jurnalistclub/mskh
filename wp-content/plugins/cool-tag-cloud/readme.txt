Special thanks to [Orman Clark](http://www.premiumpixels.com/freebies/tagtastic-tag-cloud-psd/) for the tag image and to [Dimox](http://dimox.name/beautiful-tags-markup/) for the CSS code.

3. Add the plugin's widget on the <strong>Appearance\Widgets</strong> page.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why is the font size limited to 17px? =

Because when a larger font size is set, the tag text does not fit into the tag image.

= Does the plugin support localization? =

Yes, please use [translate.wordpress.org](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/cool-tag-cloud).
